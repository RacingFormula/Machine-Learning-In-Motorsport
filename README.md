# Machine Learning in Motorsport

This repository organises projects that use machine learning to solve motorsport-related challenges. Each project leverages ML models to predict, classify, or optimise various aspects of racing performance.

## Projects

### 1. [Lap Time Prediction Model](#)
Predicts lap times based on car setup, track conditions, and driver inputs using regression models.

### 2. [Tyre Life Predictor](#)
Uses historical race data to predict the remaining life of tyres during a race.

### 3. [Overtaking Success Predictor](#)
Classifies the likelihood of successful overtakes based on track layout and car performance.

### 4. [Strategy Success Classifier](#)
Classifies race strategies as "successful" or "unsuccessful" based on historical data.

### 5. [Track Condition Classifier](#)
Predicts track conditions (e.g., dry, wet, damp) using telemetry and weather data.

## Usage
